\f0\fs24 \cf0 The current standard for organization of lecture recordings makes it difficult for students to navigate. If a student wanted to look back at a particular concept, they would have to first remember what day that concept was taught and then wade through the recording until they find it. David\'92s project, Conceptualize, would take a collection of zoom recordings and a file listing the concept name, the file name, and the time of when the professor begins talking about that concept. With this information, conceptualize splits the video files based on the concepts so that a student could more easily find the information they are looking for.}
